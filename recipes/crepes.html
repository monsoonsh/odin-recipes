        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
                Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. 
                Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
